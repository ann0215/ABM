# Agent Bassed Modelling - Escape Panic Simulation with Social Force Model

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to simulate the impact of obstacle geometry on escape efficiency, considering both individual and group behaviors. The core function revolves around modeling the movement of agents through environments with various obstacles, calculating evacuation times under different conditions, and analyzing the impact of different group sizes and obstacle configurations.

## Components


## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
aaa
```
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and tkinter (if GUI functionality is desired).

## Usage
1. Configure Simulation Parameters:
Adjust the parameters in the script according to your scenario requirements. Parameters include the number of pedestrians, group configurations, obstacle placements, etc.

2. Run Simulation:
Execute the simulation script. If GUI is enabled, the simulation will display a window showing the movement of pedestrians. For non-GUI runs, the simulation will process in the background and directly output the results.

3. Analyze Results:
Use the plotting functions to generate visualizations of the evacuation times and analyze the impacts of different configurations.
